# Project-Reflections

- In a few sentences, explain what the project was and the scope of your work. Imagine explaining your answer to a technical recruiter or a developer who you’d potentially be interviewing with who knows nothing about Turing.

The project was a test of the skills that we have been working on throughout the entirety of these last few weeks. It involved formulating a pre-project plan, thinking about possible concepts which would get our end results, and implementing them. The first portion of the project involved utilizing a Math random function which iterates through our array, and selects a single numerical value and assigns it to the array. We had to instantiate a new class, which would have values that are dynamic (and probably only needed one instance.) In hindsight we could have used default values for this, where the value could either be what is randomized OR what we made in the (make our own poster section.)

# Overall 

- What is your approach to working on a team? (In your answer, provide an example from this project)
  
  My approach is pretty fluid, I try to be dynamic to whatever my partner wants to implement. While we worked on the first iteration I continually asked what she would prefer to do.. Whenever we hit a road block or if their wasn't any other ideas, I kinda gave slight nudges into a direction that might give us better results. I explained my though process, and ensured we were both on the same page before continuing. 
  
  Same thing as teh last group my approach to this was still very fluid. Whatever they needed from me I tried my best to accomadate it.

# Technical
- You can’t work out how to solve a coding problem. What do you do to find the answer? 
 
 We didn't hit many road blocks throughout this, there had been once instance where things weren't working in the manner that we had wished but we had simply asked the other repeaters for assistance. I referred to Grant, and Irmak whenever I was stuck and then when we couldn't get the answers from them I went to my mentor. 
 
 
 We definitely utilized our resources, thankfully one of the our teamates had a significant other who is a programmer.

# Reflection

- What is one personal/professional takeaway from this project? 

After having done this project a second time I completely felt more comfortable. Even though the product was VERY similar to what I've done before, I was more capable to explain what was happening throughout each iteration. I could tell the person what each function specifically did, and was able to get my partner to understand as well. I held back a little bit from wanting to divert to testing out more difficult (foreign) concepts in this project. 

the extra things we learned really made us this time. We used advanced iterators and different methods vs what you've tried in projects prior to this. It was an amazing opportunity.
