# Project-Reflections

# Overall 

What role do you typically play on a team?

In the roles for this particular project, I was dynamic. My partner and I switched off from a driver-navigator, we were tandem throughout the entire process so it put a limitation on our errors. It also helped us learn, and complete the project at a faster rate. Each time one of us had an idea, it was talked out before it was fired off in the code. 

# Technical
You canâ€™t work out how to solve a coding problem. What do you do to find the answer? 

Throughout the entire project their had been several wrenches thrown into our plans. From the start we had commited ourselves to a syntax error that eventually caught up to us in iteration 3 & 4. We were forced to back-track, and refactor a lot of code in order to devise a better plan for our future code block. When the answers were vague, we would console.log each code-block and formulate a path to our intended goal. We reached out to both our cohort and our mentors, and these resources helped immensely. They allowed us to reach our own conclusions, and eventually our code worked in the ways it should 

# Reflection

What is one personal/professional takeaway from this project? 

With any project you need to take time to enjoy the moment you are in, instead of stressing about the deadline. During the entire process my partner and I were laughing and enjoying ourselves. Our overall morale was increased at each iteration even as we were drowning in questions. If were hit a blocker, we laughed about it and made jokes to lighten the overall mood before even devising a plan. In terms of personal, being slightly unprofessional with each other made each step that-much-more barable and actually enjoyable. Professionally, with a hightened morale we were able to soar through each iteration at a faster pace. It made learning new methods/concepts fun and entertaining, rather than defeating when answers weren't easily apparent.
